# Hello, everyone I'm ClÃ©ment Molly-Mitton! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a double degree at CentraleSupÃ©lec, where I am completing my final year specializing in Artificial Intelligence, alongside a degree in Data and Artificial Intelligence at ESILV in Paris. I have a strong passion for artificial intelligence, data science, and software development, where Iâ€™m constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and sharpen my skills. Driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate, I thrive in environments that challenge me to design intelligent, AI-driven solutions and develop impactful software systems.

## Projects

You will find here some of the projects I've worked on recently:

1. [Tetris AI](https://github.com/Bliights/Tetris-AI): A complete reimplementation of the classic Tetris game, along with an AI that learns to play it efficiently. The entire project was built from scratch using only Pygame (no additional libraries). Through this project, I learned how to implement multithreading, multiprocessing, and how to use genetic algorithms to optimize an AIâ€™s hyperparameters.
2. [Awake Wheel](https://github.com/Bliights/Awake-Wheel): A mobile application designed to detect driver drowsiness using AI. The AI model is based on VGG16 and was trained with TensorFlow, while the mobile app itself was developed using Flutter.
3. [SportsHub](https://github.com/Bliights/SportsHub): A full-stack web application for selling sports equipment. This project was an opportunity to practice building a complete website, including the frontend (Angular), backend (Express server), and database (PostgreSQL).
4. [Multi LLM](https://github.com/Bliights/Multi-LLM): A platform that allows users to interact with multiple chatbots (LLMs) while preserving a shared conversation history across models, as if continuing the same discussion.
Users can also plug in their own API keys to access premium model versions if their key allow it. This project was a great opportunity to strengthen my skills in CI/CD with GitLab, containerization with Docker, frontend development with Angular, backend architecture using both Express and Actix-web (Rust), and database management with PostgreSQL.
